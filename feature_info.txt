Code Book for the Assignment - main dataset
===========================================

*note: this is adapted from the original info document provided with the assignment data

This main dataset is generated from the run_analysis.R script and is called analysis_data.

for each observation the labelling columns are:

subject: a factor variable anonymously identifying the person carrying the phone during the observation
activity: a factor variable identifying the activity performed by the subject during the observation

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timebodyAcc-XYZ and timegravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timebodyAccJerk-XYZ and timebodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timebodyAccMag, timegravityAccMag, timebodyAccJerkMag, timebodyGyroMag, timebodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencybodyAcc-XYZ, frequencybodyAccJerk-XYZ, frequencybodyGyro-XYZ, frequencybodyAccJerkMag, frequencybodyGyroMag, frequencybodyGyroJerkMag. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

'[estimate]' is used to represent the variable estimated from the signals
'[xyz]' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

timebodyacc[estimate][xyz]
timegravityacc[estimate][xyz]
timebodyaccjerk[estimate][xyz]
timebodygyro[estimate][xyz]
timebodygyrojerk[estimate][xyz]
timebodyaccmag[estimate]
timegravityaccmag[estimate]
timebodyaccjerkmag[estimate]
timebodygyromag[estimate]
timebodygyrojerkmag[estimate]
frequencybodyacc[estimate][xyz]
frequencybodyaccjerk[estimate][xyz]
frequencybodygyro[estimate][xyz]
frequencybodyaccmag[estimate]
frequencybodyaccjerkmag[estimate]
frequencybodygyromag[estimate]
frequencybodygyrojerkmag[estimate]

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
