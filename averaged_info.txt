Code Book for the Assignment - summary dataset
==============================================

*note: this is adapted from the original info document provided with the assignment data

This summary dataset is generated from the run_analysis.R script and is called averaged_data. The data here is obtained by grouping all the obeservations by subject and by activity and calculating the average value of each observed variable for each group.

for each observation the labelling columns are:

subject: a factor variable anonymously identifying the person carrying the phone during the observation
activity: a factor variable identifying the activity performed by the subject during the observation

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timebodyAcc-XYZ and timegravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timebodyAccJerk-XYZ and timebodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timebodyAccMag, timegravityAccMag, timebodyAccJerkMag, timebodyGyroMag, timebodyGyroJerkMag). 

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencybodyAcc-XYZ, frequencybodyAccJerk-XYZ, frequencybodyGyro-XYZ, frequencybodyAccJerkMag, frequencybodyGyroMag, frequencybodyGyroJerkMag. 

Finally since all observations for a given group are averaged, the variable names are prefix with "average" to make it clear by looking at the data frame itself.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

'[estimate]' is used to represent the variable estimated from the signals
'[xyz]' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

averagetimebodygyro[estimate][xyz]

averagetimebodyaccmag[estimate]

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
